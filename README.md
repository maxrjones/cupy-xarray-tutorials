Welcome to the CUPY-Xarray Jupyter Notebooks repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the usage of CUPY-Xarray, a library that combines the power of CUPY and Xarray for accelerated computation and analysis of large datasets.

The materials and notebooks in this tutorial is published as a Jupyter book here. [![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://ncar.github.io/dask-tutorial/README.html)

## What is CUPY-Xarray?

[CUPY-Xarray](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/cupy-xarray) is a Python library that leverages Cupy, a GPU array library, and Xarray, a library for multi-dimensional labeled array computations, to enable fast and efficient data processing on GPUs. By combining the capabilities of Cupy and Xarray, CUPY-Xarray provides a convenient interface for performing accelerated computations and analysis on large multidimensional datasets.

## Notebooks

This repository contains the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. Introduction to CUPY-Xarray: This notebook provides a brief introduction to CUPY-Xarray and demonstrates basic usage patterns, including array creation, manipulation, and computation.
2. Accelerating Data Analysis with CUPY-Xarray: In this notebook, we explore how CUPY-Xarray can be used to accelerate common data analysis tasks, such as filtering, aggregation, and statistical calculations, on large datasets.
3. Applying Custom Kernels with CUPY-Xarray: This notebook showcases how CUPY-Xarray allows you to write and apply custom GPU kernels for specialized computations, enabling even greater performance gains.
